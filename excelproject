Project Overview: Market Basket Analysis (Retail Market Basket Analysis)
This project focuses on analyzing customer purchasing behavior in retail by examining product sales data. 
The goal is to identify frequently purchased products based on the day of the week and time of day, as well as to determine
the likelihood of products being purchased together. The analysis is divided into three main components:

---
 "Best cart with 3 products" Page
   - Objective: Identify the most frequently co-purchased products and calculate their probabilities of appearing together in the same basket.
   - Steps:
     1. Product Pair Analysis: Determine how often each product appears in the same basket as another product. For example, how many times are "bread" and "milk" purchased together?
     2. Top Pairs: Identify the most frequent pair for each product. For example, "bread" is most often purchased with "milk."
     3. Top Triplets: Find the third product most frequently purchased with a given pair. For example, "bread" and "milk" are most often purchased with "cheese."
     4. Probability Calculation: Compute the probabilities of these pairs and triplets appearing together in the same basket.

 "Top Triplets by Hour" Page
   - Objective: Analyze sales data to identify the most sold products during specific hours of the day.
   - Steps:
     1. Group Sales by Hour: Organize sales data into some time intervals 
     2. Top Products per Hour: Identify the top 3 most sold products for each hour.
     3. Top Triplets per Hour: Determine the top 3 products most frequently purchased together during each hour.

 "Top Triplets by Weekday" Page
   - Objective: Analyze sales data to identify the most sold products on specific days of the week.
   - Steps:
     1. Group Sales by Weekday: Organize sales data by days of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.).
     2. Top Products per Day: Identify the top 3 most sold products for each day.
     3. Top Triplets per Day: Determine the top 3 products most frequently purchased together on each day.
