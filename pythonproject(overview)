Project Description
This project analyzes Pokémon data using Python and various data analysis libraries. It focuses on identifying patterns,
trends, and insights from a Pokémon dataset, including type distributions, statistical summaries, and visualization-based insights.  

Key Features & Analysis

Data Loading & Preprocessing
   - Uses Pandas to read Pokémon data from an Excel file.  
   - Cleans and structures the dataset for analysis.  

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Identifies the most common Pokémon types.  
   - Uses grouping and sorting to determine Pokémon distribution by type.  
   - Detects outliers in Pokémon statistics (e.g., Base Total) using the IQR method.  

Statistical Insights 
   - Computes key percentiles to understand Pokémon attributes.  
   - Identifies Pokémon with significantly higher or lower base stats.  

Data Visualization 
   - Uses Matplotlib and Seaborn to create graphs and visualizations  
   - Displays Pokémon distribution across different categories.  

Technologies Used 
- Python  
- Pandas (Data Manipulation)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)  
- NumPy (Statistical Analysis)
